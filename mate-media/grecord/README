MATE Sound record (grecord) is a simple program for recording
and playing sound files.
You can start it by either typing 'grecord' at the command line
or selecting MATE menu->Multimedia->Soundrecorder if you're
running MATE.

It's goal isn't to be a super ultra wav editor, just to
be able to play and record, and later, be able
to do some basic "effects".
