WHAT IT IS

to and making an incessant irritating buzzing sound whne you don't want them
to and wish they would just stick to clinging to walls.

WHAT IT PROVIDES
----------------

This provides:

a) a function to get a dialog to edit audio profiles

GapProfilesEdit *
gm_audio_profiles_edit_new ()

b) a function to get a dialog to edit a specific audio profile based on its id

GapProfileEdit *
gm_audio_profile_edit_new (const char *id)
{
}

c) functions to manipulate the profiles
   - get list/count of profiles
   - get profile specifics
    
d) a function to get a dialog to choose a profile from
GtkDialog *
gm_audio_profile_choose ()


TODO
----
* make audio-profile.h have public functions, and move rest to .c
* rename all functions in there to mate_... so they won't clash in the
  future
* figure out a way to make the GMAudioSettingsMask private (we can't due
  to the signal in the parent class)
