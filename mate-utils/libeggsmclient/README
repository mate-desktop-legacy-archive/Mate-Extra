MATE-Client in the libmateui library will be removed from the MATE 
software stack [1].  At this time, a replacement for the session 
management client has not been added to GTK+.  The code in this 
directory is a copy of the session management source code in the 
libegg library.  Hopefully, this will be a temporary solution.

The bugzilla report at bugs.mate.org is #79285, "session management
support".
