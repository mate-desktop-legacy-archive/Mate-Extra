MATE-Entry in the libmateui library will be removed from the MATE
software stack [1].  At this time, a replacement for the MATE Entry 
widget has not been added to GTK+.  The code in this directory
is based on a widget from the gedit source code.

The bugzilla report at bugs.mate.org is #161483, "gtk-combo-box-entry
missing a history feature".
