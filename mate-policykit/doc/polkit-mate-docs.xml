      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>
        The PolicyKit model provides letting an user authenticate in
        order to gain the privilege to let a Mechanism carry work out
        related to a specific Action on the users behalf. In the
        PolicyKit libraries, this functionality is programmatically
        exposed in the PolKitGrant class. As it's tedious to use this
        low-level functionality from a GTK+ or MATE application, the
        high-level functionality is wrapped in a D-Bus service
        available on the session message bus. The way it works is that
        when an application needs privileges, it can call into this
        D-Bus service and an authentication dialog will appear. When
        the user is done with the authentication dialog, the
        application recieves a reply from the D-Bus containing a
        boolean indicating whether the user gained the privilege or
        not.
      </para>
    </refsect1>

    <refsect1 id="ref-auth-daemon-overview-dbus">
      <title>D-Bus interface</title>
      <para>
        The D-Bus service is available on the session message bus with
        the
        name <literal>org.freedesktop.PolicyKit.AuthenticationAgent</literal>
        and exports a single object <literal>/</literal> that
        implements the
        interface <literal>org.freedesktop.PolicyKit.AuthenticationAgent</literal>. The
        D-Bus introspection XML looks like this

      <para>
        The <literal>ObtainAuthorization()</literal> method may throw
        an exception if another client is currently using the service
        to show an authentication dialog. In practice this should
        never happen because the authentication daemon grabs the X11
        keyboard and pointer thus preventing the user from activating
        widgets in other applications that would lead to calling into
        the <literal>ObtainAuthorization</literal> method.
      </para>
    </refsect1>

    <refsect1 id="ref-auth-daemon-operation">
      <title>Operation</title>
      <para>
        The authentication daemon uses
        <literal>libpolkit-grant</literal> which in turn uses PAM for
        authentication services (however, other authentication
        back-ends can be plugged in as required). As such, a wide
        range of authentication mechanisms are available.
      </para>
      <para>
        The authentication daemon is using D-Bus activation and exits
        after 30 seconds of inactivity. Thus the code implementing
        this dialog only runs when necessary.
      </para>
    </refsect1>

    <refsect1 id="ref-auth-daemon-ui-elements">
      <title>UI elements</title>
      <para>
        The appearance of the authentication dialog depends on the
        result from PolicyKit and also whether administrator
        authentication is defined as "authenticate as the root user"
        or "authenticate as one of the users from UNIX group wheel" or
        however the PolicyKit library is configured (see
        the <literal>PolicyKit.conf(5)</literal> manual page for
        details). Note that some of the screenshots below were made on
        a system set up to use
        the <ulink url="http://thinkfinger.sourceforge.net/"><citetitle>ThinkFinger</citetitle></ulink>
        PAM module.
      </para>

      <para>
        The text shown in the authentication dialogs stems from the
        PolicyKit <literal>.policy</literal> XML files residing
        in <literal>/usr/share/PolicyKit/policy</literal> and is read
        by the authentication daemon when an applications uses
        the <literal>ShowDialog()</literal> method. Thus, what the
        user sees is not under application control (e.g. it's not
        passed from the application) which rules out a class of
        attacks where applications are trying to fool the user into
        gaining a privilege.
