MATE Bluetooth
===============

mate-bluetooth is a fork of bluez-mate focused on integration with
the MATE desktop environment.

mate-bluetooth is the historical name of the first MATE focused
Bluetooth effort for Linux. As such, when the need came to name
this project, we selected something that was still in the people's
minds.

You can find historical versions of mate-bluetooth in the MATE SVN
repository at:
  http://svn.mate.org/viewvc/mate-bluetooth/trunk/

mate-bluetooth does not include the bluez-mate analyzer, or the
proximity tool.
