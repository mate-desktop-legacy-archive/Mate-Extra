Discussion about mate-terminal should happen on desktop-devel-list@mate.org,
mate-list@mate.org, or usability@mate.org, depending on what sort of
discussion it is. Reporting a bug on http://bugzilla.mate.org is equally fine.

Remember that the terminal emulation is provided by the VTE widget, maintained
as the 'vte' module on the MATE SVN. The mate-terminal product in bugzilla
only covers the menubar, toolbar, and command line options, essentially. VTE,
in turn, is responsible for the actual terminal display.
