Music Applet is a small, simple MATE panel applet that lets you control a
variety of different music players from the panel.  Music Applet provides
easy access to information about the current song and the most important
playback controls.

Music Applet currently supports the following music players:

  * Amarok (http://amarok.kde.org/)

  * Audacious (http://audacious-media-player.org/)

  * Banshee (http://banshee-project.org/)

  * Exaile (http://www.exaile.org/)

  * MPD (http://www.musicpd.org/)

  * Muine (http://muine-player.org/)

  * Quod Libet (http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet)

  * Rhythmbox (http://www.mate.org/projects/rhythmbox/)

  * VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

  * XMMS (http://www.xmms.org/)

  * XMMS2 (http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/)

Music Applet uses a simple plugin system to make adding support for
additional music players relatively simple.  See README.plugins for
details.

Music Applet is the successor to Rhythmbox Applet.
