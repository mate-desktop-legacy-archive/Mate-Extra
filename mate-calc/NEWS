----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 5.21.0

    * Fix for bug #326938 – Display cursor in input area; allow home and 
      end keys. This is in arithmetic precedence mode only.

    * Fix for bug #484158 – Setting Accuracy is incorrect via the 0-9 places 
      menu items.

    * Fix for bug #439087 – Gcalctool can't handle small physic constants
      like the Boltzmann constant. The number of significant places has
      been increased to 99 and the number of displayable digits has been
      increased to 200. The online help has been adjusted to reflect these
      changes.

      Note that if you have something in the gcalctool display that is
      wider than the display area, a scrollbar is shown, but the first
      digit isn't properly displayed. The workaround here, is to enlarge
      the size of the calculator window until the scrollbar goes away.
      I believe this is a Gtk+ problem and have filed bug #482688 against 
      it.

    * Fixed bug #367738 – [doc] Square root documentation needs to be updated.
      The entry in the online help now includes examples for both arithmetic
      precedence and non-arithmetic precedence mode.

    * Fixed bug #428571 – [doc] Repetitive usage of "use".

    * Use MATE_MAINTAINER_MODE_DEFINES() to handle *_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

    * Fixed bug #428573 – [doc] Spelling of logical gates.
      The logical operations, And, Not, Or, Xor and Xnor now use uppercase
      letters (AND, NOT, OR, XOR and XNOR) for both the buttons and in the
      display area in arithmetic precedence mode. The gcalctool manual
      pages and the online help have been updated accordingly.

      The XOR operation in non-arithmetic mode was doing a multiplication
      instead.

      The result for the AND example in the online help was incorrect.

      The syntax for using NOT in aritmetic mode is different then for
      non-arithmetic mode. The online help example has been updated to
      show both examples.

    *  Fixed bug #469245 – Hexadecimal input is not intuitive and
      bug #455889 – Copy/paste of lower case hex letter does not work.
      The hexadecimal digits have been changed back to their pre Sept
      2003 (bug #118826) values of "a" - "f".

      The following functions have also had their keyboard shortcuts
      reverted back to their pre Sept 2003 upper-case values:

      [A] - Set accuracy
      [C] - Change sign
      [D] - Double-declining depreciation
      [E] - Enter an exponential number
      [F] - User-defined functions

      With copy/paste operations, where the user is pasting a string into
      gcalctool, the copy buffer is now iterated over. If an "A", "B", "C",
      "D" or "F" character is encountered, it will be converted to its
      lowercase equivalent. If an "E" is found,  and the next character is a
      "-" or a "+", then it remains as an upper case "E" (it's assumed to be
      a possible exponential number), otherwise its converted to a lower
      case "e".

      Displaying of hex digits in the gcalctool display will still be
      in uppercase. Displaying of the "e" in an exponential number will
      still be in lower-case.

      The way to enter exponential numbers in arithmetic precedence mode
      has changed. The following four examples should show you the new
      correct syntax:

        1  2  Exp + 8  =              1200000000
      - 1  2  Exp + 8  =             -1200000000
        1  2  Exp - 8  =              0.00000012
      - 1  2  Exp - 8  =             -0.00000012

      In both left-to-right precedence and arithmetic precedence modes, if
      the user enters a numeric digit that is incorrect for the current
      numeric base, this shouldn't be allowed and should not be entered
      in the display.

      The gcalctool documentation (and tooltips) have been updated to
      reflect these changes.

    * Fixed bug #479102 – memory registers dialogue should use ngettext.

    * Fixed bug #478961 – GtkAaction use.

    * Fixed bug #478964 – don't use deprecated gtk_widget_ref func.

    * Fixed bug #478979 – show menu help in statusbar.

  initial string constant values to be confident that they are not in 
  read-only memory.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.31

* Fixed bug 129539.  The thousands separator is a null terminated string, 
  not a single character. Same for the radix.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.29

* Fixed bug 128603. The changes for enhancement request #126626 which added 
  thousands separator support caused a crash at startup time on a Debian 
  system. The initial constant strings are being put in read-only memory 
  either by gcc (or because of the way that x86 arch is designed). This was 
  not a problem when tested with the Sun compilers on a Solaris SPARC machine.
  The remove_tsep() routine is display.c has been rewritten to correctly 
  handle this.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.28

* Further work on enhancement request 125873. As the user is typing in 
  input, the display will now show the thousands separator (if checked).

----

* Re-fixed bug 127672. The fix for Shift-"=" should have been for GDK_equal 
  not GDK_Return.  Needed to add in support for Shift-"/" too.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.25

* Implemented enhancement request 125873. gcalctool can now optionally 
  show the thousands seperator character for fixed point numbers displayed 
  in the decimal base. Same for numbers stored in the memory registers. 
  There is a new "Show Thousands Separator" menu entry in the View menu 
  to set this.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.24

* Fixed bug 126626. gcalctool no longer causes a Gtk-CRITICAL error when 
  the user enters "9*(1<Xor>". The problem was caused because a non-UTF 
  character was being inserted into the text string to be displayed for 
  the Xor function.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.23

* Fixed bug 125782. If the user is entering a left parenthesis and it is 
  the first one being displayed and there is no current arithmetic operand,
  then the current display is initially cleared to avoid the confusion of 
  showing something like "0(".

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.22

* Fixed bug 127862. The fix for bug #125625 introduced a potential 
  out-of-order case for users who are rapid keyboard typers. This 
  bug fix rectifies this with the unfortunate side-effect of no longer 
  visual toggling the equivalent button to the keyboard character 
  that the user entered. This fix is still compatible with the way 
  the accessibility infrastructure works though.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.21

* Fixed bug 65806. For the "1/x", "x^2", "x!", "e^x", "10^x" and

  The "e" in "e^x" is no longer italicized.

----

  Bugtraq bug #1258472 against CDE dtcalc (which was also a problem with 
  gcalctool) was incorrect.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.19

* Fixed bug 127672. The "=" key on a Swedish keyboard is on the upper 
  level of a key (i.e. the Shift key needs to be down). Added another 
  mask/keysym pair to the "=" entry to handle this.

----

  mask/keysym pair to the "+" entry to handle this.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.14

  for bug #118826.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.11

* Refixed bug 122373. gcalctool now uses nl_langinfo() to get the numeric 
  point for the users locale, rather than via a localised string.

----

Overview of changes in gcalctool 4.3.10

* Fixed enhancement #65806. Changed that label for e^x (e superscript x) to
