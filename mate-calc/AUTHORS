The maths library used by gcalctool is based on the freely available MP
multi-precision floating-point arithmetic package originally written in
FORTRAN by Richard Brent in the 1970's, when he was with the Computer
Centre, Australian National University.

It has been converted from FORTRAN into C using the freely available
f2c translator, available via netlib on research.att.com.

The subsequently converted C code has then been tidied up, mainly to
remove any dependencies on the libI77 and libF77 support libraries.

More information on this MP package can be found at:
