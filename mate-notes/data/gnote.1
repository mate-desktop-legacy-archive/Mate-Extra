.B Gnote
is a desktop note-taking application for Linux and Unix. Simple and
easy to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas and
information you deal with every day.
.PP
Gnote's usefulness lies in the ability to relate notes and ideas
together, using a WikiWiki-like linking system.
.PP
When run without any options, the Gnote note menu appears in the
Mate Panel's notification tray area.  Selecting a note from the menu
displays the note's spatial window.

Changes to notes are saved automatically.  Links to URLs, files, and
other notes are detected as you type.  Rich editing such as
highlighting, bold, italics, undo/redo, and variable font sizes are
supported.

Global keybindings exist to allow fast access to Gnote notes and
dialogs.  These keybindings are set in MateConf (see below) and may be
activated from any application.
