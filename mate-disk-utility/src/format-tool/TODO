code.

Short-term:
  DONE, NEEDS_TESTING - refresh after operation succesfully finished, make Revert button work as expected (need to retrieve GduPresentable again)
  DONE - PolicyKit integration
  DONE - Stop button (once PolicyKit integration is done)
    DONE - window close action should be ignored (+ Escape, Alt+F4 keybindings...)
  DONE - simple standalone mode
  REMOVED - do we need Bootable flag for something?
  DONE - make a Fedora package
  DONE, NEEDS_TESTING - !! set partition type too !!  (only for MBR?)
  OK - check label length before formatting (should be done automatically) -- DK returning wrong values for FAT and NTFS
  DONE - get rid of the Revert button
  DONE - call luks_lock() beside unmount, that would allow formatting active LUKS devices
  DONE - install to libexec
  DONE - add Palimpsest button
  - display mount warning and perform unmount of all nested partitions, in case of LUKS

Standalone mode:
  DONE - refresh volume selector on hotplug/unplug
  DONE - carefully count references (valgrind)
  DONE - UI cleanup: get rid of those twin icons (show them only when expanded)
                     find a way how to expand the combo box to full width
  DONE - desktop file
  DONE - icon
  DONE - display insensitive placeholder item "Please select a volume to format"



- handle LUKS encrypted volumes -- creating new encrypted media works fine, but reverting back to non-encrypted doesn't (device /dev/sdb1 vs. /dev/dm-0)
DONE, NEEDS_TESTING - monitor device/presentable events like eject, umount etc. (try to pull the USB key out and window should disappear)
- show custom icon if user has set it in Caja
REMOVED- is firmware needed for some devices?
DONE - different partition tables?
DONE - what to do if device is blank (zeroed, no MBR)?
DONE - handle read only device - gdu_device_is_read_only() - test with DVD-RAM media
- stay consistent with volume labels in Caja and gdu (requires gvfs-devicekit port)
NOT NEEDED- localization (transifex? -- ask hughsie)
- test multihead (need to ref screen of the source caja window)
- caja integration: be able to spawn the dialog from sidebar
DONE - make standalone mode optional (configure --enable-standalone)
DONE - duplicate /dev/sr0 device in the list when media is present
- don't show Caja menu item when no media is in drive or device is readonly


Ideas:
 - allow NTFS formatting and popup a PackageKit window when ntfs-3g is not available (shamelessly stolen from mate-format discussion)
 DONE - make standalone executable with a device/volume combo box to format
 - maybe add a button to unmount the volume so user can close all applications properly?
 - mount volume back if we did unmount before formatting?

Bugs:
 - Busy dialog eats too much CPU and freezes UI
 - DeviceKit-disks should require mtools (for FAT labeling)
 - libgdu should return always valid presentable names
 NO - should the presentable instance from the pool::presentable-{added,changed,removed} signals be unreffed?
 - complete CD-RW medium is not marked as readonly -- are we gonna have burning backend in DK-disks?
 - would be great to have gdu_pool_get_toplevel_presentables()
 - gdu_presentable_get_toplevel() always returns valid presentable even if it's already toplevel (i.e. /dev/md0), never returns NULL
 - gdu_device_drive_get_media_compatibility() returns const char* pointers - check and document properly
 - BUG !! gdu_device_op_partition_create() and gdu_device_op_partition_table_create() should spawn their finish callbacks only after device is ready (and pool up-to-date) so we can start another operation right away
 SOLVED - find a way to reliably detect active LUKS on the device
