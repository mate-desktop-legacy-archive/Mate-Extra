    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Writing a Caja-Python extension is a fairly straight-forward process. 
    One simply imports the caja module and creates a class which is derived from a number 
    of the caja module's classes. When an extension derives a class, it becomes a "provider", 
    telling Caja to ask it for information. There are several types of providers 
    available for extensions to use: there is MenuProvider, LocationWidgetProvider, 
    ColumnProvider, PropertyPageProvider, and InfoProvider, all of which will be explained 
    in more detail below. Your class can be derived from multiple providers.</para>
    
    <para>Here are the basic steps:</para>
    
    <para>1. A script is written and installed to the standard python extensions install path</para>
    <para>2. Caja is (re)started and loads the Caja-Python C extension, which in turn loads all python extensions</para>
    <para>3. Any python script in the standard python extensions install path that imports the caja module and derives 
    the main class from a caja module class will be loaded</para>
    
    <note>
<title>A note about the standard python extensions install path</title>

<para>The install path for individual users is ~/.caja/python-extensions. </para>
<para>The system-wide install path is $PREFIX/lib/caja/extensions-2.0/python. However, some 64 bit distributions, 
such as Fedora, put Caja-Python extensions in $PREFIX/lib64/caja/extensions-2.0/python. </para>
<para>As of caja-python 0.7.0, caja-python looks in ~/.local/share/caja-python/extensions 
for local extensions and $PREFIX/share/caja-python/extensions for global extensions.</para>
