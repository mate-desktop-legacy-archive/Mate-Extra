0.7.2:
    - Fix to get the PyCapsule patch to work even if there is no PyCapsule 
        object set up for pygtk.

0.7.1:
    - Fixed AM_CHECK_PYTHON_LIBS usage of test (MATE bug #619440)
    - Cleaned up the docs Makefile.am to make it more consistent
    - Fix some python3 syntax issues in the python.m4 script
    - Add python 2.7 support (MATE bug #633171)

        caja.MenuProvider.get_toolbar_items_full

    - Added complete gtk-doc documentation: tutorial and reference.  Enable
        by adding the --enable-gtk-doc argument to ./configure or ./autogen.sh
    - Updated the autogen.sh file so it is not a copied-over obsolete version
        of mate-autogen.sh, but a shell that calls the user's installed
        mate-autogen.sh.
    - Removed obsolete .spec file
    - Removed obsolete examples/documentation.py file
    - Added an example plugin for the LocationWidgetProvider
    - Look for python plugins in $XDG_DATA_DIR/caja-python/extensions.  This
        includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever $XDG_DATA_DIR is set
        to)

0.6.1:
    - Look for libpython2.6.so.1.0 instead of libpython2.6.so, the latter 
	is general available from -devel packages only.
    - Re-added the missing spec and pc files
    - Free pygobject data directly after using file objects.  Stops seg 
	faults from occurring when caja wants to free pygobject data
	after Py_Finalize() is called.

        and get_parent_location methods to the CajaFileInfo object
    - Added the CajaMenu.get_items method
    - Updated some example plugins
    - Bug fix for some PyThreadState_New segmentation faults
    - Use the caja prefix by default for distfiles, rather than /usr
    - Require caja-2.22 and pygobject-2.16 now that we support GIO
