	Trying to get to a sane state.  I apparently don't know as much
	about library versioning as I thought I did.

2009-04-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Hiding all of the functions that part of the DBus interface in that
	now they're all prefixed with '_' so that they don't get exported
	as part of the library symbols.  This should simplify everything a
	little bit for implementors.

2009-04-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Getting rid of everything starting with 'd'.  This gets rid of the dbus stuff that isn't set up to be static, which is silly.

	I can't believe I messed up this one.  Luckily it doesn't seem to have
	caused any bugs.  Man.

2009-04-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching around the show_interest and remove_interest functions so that
	they are now asyncronous.  Not that being asynchronous is important but
	more that now they get the Method Invocation interface that we can use
	to find out the sender of the message.  Changed various APIs as a result
	of this, and moved the DBus functions to be internal.

2009-04-01  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding new functions show_interest and remove_interest into the API.  Now to fill in the backend.

2009-04-01  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a remove and show interest

2009-04-01  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Change the API so it's more like we're keeping a list of what, and who are interested in.  This'll make it easier for us to manage all the DBus nastyness.

2009-02-17  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	This is a generated file.  Shouldn't be in VCS.

2009-02-16  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a couple of files to the distribution to pass distcheck

2009-02-15  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	This function seems to set up the widget correctly with the background.  It's undocumented, but most other applets seem to do it.

2009-02-15  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Putting a little handle on the indicators.  Works for GNOME Panel.

2009-02-15  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	messages more clear between the two.

2009-02-15  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a new signal in that handles the ID of zero, or null, comming
	back from a listener and uses that to show the server.  Or atleast
	signal it to figure out how to do that.  Also cleaning up the signals
	a little to use defines.

2009-02-15  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a check for NULL string in the icon parsing code.  This will
	stop a bunch of warnings coming from everything else.

2009-02-13  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in the function to take a pixbuf, turn it into a png, base64 encode it and then send it across the wire.

2009-02-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Changing the icon data to be base64 encoded, should have done that originally, how silly.

2009-02-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Seems like a better name

2009-02-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fixing some prototypes to fix warnings and errors we haven't yet encountered.  Also setting the type so that our switch statement actually works.

2009-02-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Building a way to get properties.  Seems like this should be in the DBus
	libs, but anyway.  Here is the code that compiles and claims that it'll
	do it.  More code than I would have liked.

2009-02-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding properties for doing type and desktop

2009-02-05  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Changing the DBUS API slightly.  Now there is no 'get_desktop' function as desktop is a property.  Added a property for type so that we can understand what kind of application this is.  And finally adding show/hide signals on the server as they were already on the listener.

	Use the new fangled defines to make things cleaner

2009-01-29  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-01-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Building the listener object that listens to all of the folks on DBus and turns that into a usable interface for indicator display folks.  A lot of code to make things simple :)

2009-01-14  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, I think this is the end of server and indicator minus all
	the bugs that I expect to find :)

2009-01-14  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in code from yesterday.  Got many of the functions working with
	real IDs and making lists.  The basis for all the properties stuff is there
	but it still needs a touch of fleshing out.  Also a new test for debugging.

2009-01-16  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Changing the build targets, now I understand the difference between 'any' and 'all'

2009-01-16  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	builds as otherwise they end up getting built first.

2009-01-16  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a return that was missing (though it's useless)

2009-01-16  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>
