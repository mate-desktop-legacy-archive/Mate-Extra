This is GKB, a Mate applet to change your keymap with a mouse-click
or hotkey combination.

Thanks for Balazs Nagy <julian7@iksz.hu> for his major help at
start and Charles Levert <charles@comm.polymtl.ca> for beautiful 
dynamic keyboard layout. I would like to say thanks to Emese Kovacs 
<emese@mate.hu>, who helps me every day and to Chema Celorio
<chema@celorio.com> who is great in groupwork.

Lot of thanx to Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com> and
Carlos Lopez <natorro@themis.fciencias.unam.mx> for many beauty
flags.

Feel free to bomb me any suggestions, ideas.
