TODO:

* use history for command completion, too

* use a real shell (like bash) optionally as backend

* Using mate-libs call instead of starting mate-brower via exec?
  [suggested by Kevin M Fox <kmfox@mail.bhi-erc.com>]

* using prefixes from control-center [suggested by Kevin M Fox
  <kmfox@mail.bhi-erc.com>]

* autodetection of non-X programs

	* Using ldd to do this? [suggested by Al Wold
          <alwold@inter-web.net>]

* The ability to paste into it like an xterm [drag and drop] would be
  nice. [suggested by Brian J. Murrell <brian@interlinx.bc.ca>]

* better filename completion via [tab] [or is it good enough now?]

* make "/bin/sh" changeable [is this really needed?]

* completing documentation

* support of speech recognition ;-)

* Mini-commander as of the .99.3 tar files randomly shrinks itself
  very small, > if you pull it off and put it back, it goes to
  normal. [Fox, Kevin M <KMFox@mail.bhi-erc.com>] [Well, this is a
  feature ;-) which is especially useful for people with a vertical
  panel.  Perhaps I will make this an option.]

* If I change the timezone of my laptop (as I travel) while
  minicommander is running, the time does not get updated to reflect
  the new time zone.  [by Cengiz Alaettinoglu <cengiz@isi.edu>]

* allow multi-line macros

* allow other scripting languages

* use mate scripting features (eg. guile) for macros

* make handle box appear/disappear immediately

* separately customizable date and time fonts [by Henri Binsztok
  <hbbio@bigfoot.com>]


DONE:

* I wish I had to set up the `macros' using regular expressions
  instead of just prefixes. It would be *far* more flexible [by
  Alejandro Forero Cuervo <bachue@bachue.com>]

* make handle box optional

* working command completion when using a prefix

* storing history

* Searchable command history, or a key/button to bring up a window
  with a "clickable" command history, or a pulldown or something like
  that.  [suggested by Brian J. Murrell <brian@interlinx.bc.ca>]

* storing preferences

* filename completion via tab

* preferences dialog

	* enable/disable clock

	* configure (one or more) web browsers

* history

* enable launching of non-X programs

* don't store dupes in history
