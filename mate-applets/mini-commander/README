Mini-Commander
--------------

This MATE applet adds a command line to the panel. It features
command completion, command history, changeable macros and an optional
built-in clock.

You can simply start any program by typing its name. You often have
not to enter the full name but only the first characters followed by
the [tab] key. Mini-Commander will try to complete the program name in
the same way most UNIX shells do.

The last commands can be recalled by pressing the [ArrowUp] or
[ArrowDown] keys. This works like the command history in most UNIX
shells.

Mini-Commander has some predefined macros. For example if you enter
"term:command" then "command" is executed in a terminal window. Or if
you enter an URL then your web browser is used to view it.
Additionally you can define your own macros or change the predefined
ones.

There is a built-in clock which can optionally show the date or can be
completely disabled.
