	* Macros are defined via regular expressions instead of
	  prefixes.  This nice idea has been suggested by Alejandro
	  Forero Cuervo.

	* Really no dupes are stored in the command history.

	* The size and layout of the applet will be modified
          automatically if the panel size is changed.

	* Command completion is now provided by a new function by
          Travis Hume.  Since his routine is not based on a bash
          script (like my old function) it should be faster.

	* Mini-Commander has no longer an internal version number.
	  Instead the version number of MATE is used from now on.

	* Halfline had the idea to implement an history base auto
	  completion and wrote the inital code.  This feature is
	  optional.


Release 1.0.0:
	
	* This is v1.0.0 because all basic features have been
	  implemented.

	* Allow pasting into the input box with the middle mouse
	  button (idea taken from the applet WebControl by Garrett
	  Smith).

	* Prefix matching has been improved.

	* Three very useful macros from Chad Powell have been added.
	  I had to increase the maximum allowed macro length just for
	  his macros ;-). You need to remove ~/.mate/mini-commander
	  to get this new default macro.  Here is Chad's own
	  description:

		The following macro for the Mini-Commander allows you
		to enter av:searchstring and search on altavista.  It
		automatically changes ", +, and spaces to the right
		characters for the url.  I thought you might want to
		add this to the default macros.  I got the idea from
		the new web-search applet, thought that rather than
		have a seperate applet, it would be pretty easy to
		make Mini-Commander do it.

	  He also wrote macros for yahoo and freshmeat which have been
	  included as default macros.

	* Signal handler installation routine has been rewritten.
	  Hopefully this will fix the "zombie" problem which a few
	  people (Charles Duffy and Brian J. Murrell) have reported.


	* A patch from Nick Lamb has been added which makes the handle
	  box optional.  He writes:

		I saw in your TODO, that you wanted to make the
		Handle-box widget optional, and since people not a
		million miles from me in this lab kept moaning about
		it, I had an itch to scratch :)



Release 0.0.14:

	* Mini-Commander can be detached from panel. This is useful
          for people who use vertical panel.

	* Up to 99 changeable macros are supported.

	* File browser added.

	* Clickable history list added. [suggested by Brian J. Murrell]

	* Dupes are no longer stored in command history.

	* History is stored when the program is terminated and
	  restored when it is started later.

	* Command completion has been enhanced.  Now it works even
	  if a prefix is used.  Also it delivers the largest possible
	  completion even if the given command is not unique.

	* Preferences bug fixed.

	  (for non-X programs).
