This version (0.04) adds pixmap themes to gEyes.

GTK+ 1.2.1 changed the behavior of gdk_pixmap_new ().  It used to accept -1 for
color depth, in which case GDK would use the given window's depth.  It decided
it didn't want to do that anymore.  0.03 works around this.

Oops - There was a little typo in 0.02 that prevented the applet from 
restarting with the panel.  I fixed that and released 0.02a.  I am an idiot.
