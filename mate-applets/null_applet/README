What the hell is a Null Applet?
===============================

The Null Applet is the Applet Deprecation Applet. It allows us to remove applets
from a users configuration, without them getting cryptic messages about being
unable to resolve things, and getting a raw dump of preferences (the panel likes
to do this). In the future, the null applet will also be useful for when someone
decides not to build one of the optional applets, to prevent them from seeing
the same ugly message.

How do I add an applet to Null Applet?
======================================

Copy the original .server.in.in file over and rename to a .server.in file,
remove the factory, set its location to MATE_NullApplet_Factory and
remove the panel:icon attribute that it doesn't appear in the add to
panel list.

Why is the Wireless Applet .server file here?
=============================================

The wireless applet was deprecated in favour of mate-netstatus, but we
still install a .server file of the same name pointing the old applet
id at the netstatus applet.
