MateConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. :-) It's being written for the MATE
desktop but does not require MATE; configure should notice if MATE
is not installed and compile the basic MateConf library anyway.

MateConf does require glib, MateCORBA, libxml, and the popt option parsing
library.  libxml will be optional in the future if someone writes another
storage backend. (Update: one is written but not enabled by default yet.)

There's a mailing list mateconf-list@mate.org, see
http://mail.mate.org/mailman/listinfo/mateconf-list.

The MateConf maintainer is Havoc Pennington <hp@redhat.com>. Bugs and
patches should be filed in Bugzilla, http://bugzilla.mate.org,
against the MateConf product. Send questions and comments to Havoc or to
mateconf-list@mate.org.
