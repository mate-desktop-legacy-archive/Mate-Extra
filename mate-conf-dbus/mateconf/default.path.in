# This file stores the addresses of config sources for MateConf
# When a value is stored or requested, the sources are scanned from top to 
# bottom, and the first one to have a value for the key (or the first one 
# to be writeable) is used to load/store the data.

# See the MateConf manual for details

# Look first in systemwide mandatory settings directory
xml:readonly:@sysmateconfdir@/mateconf.xml.mandatory

# To read in any mandatory settings that the Sys Admin may have created
# prior to a desktop system upgrade. The SysAdmin can stick read-only system
# wide sources in this file.
include @sysmateconfdir@/2/local-mandatory.path

# Now see where users want us to look - basically the user can stick arbitrary 
# sources in a ~/.mateconf.path file and they're inserted here
include "$(HOME)/.mateconf.path"

# Give users a default storage location, ~/.mateconf
xml:readwrite:$(HOME)/.mateconf

# To read in any defaults settings that the Sys Admin may have created
# prior to a desktop system upgrade. The SysAdmin can stick default values
# system-wide in this file.
include @sysmateconfdir@/2/local-defaults.path

# Finally, look at the systemwide defaults
