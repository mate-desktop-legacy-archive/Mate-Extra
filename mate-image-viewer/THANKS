Many kudos, thanks, beers, and brownie points to:

	Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org> - Wrote the initial versions
	of GdkPixbuf, and bravely maintained Imlib for MATE's
	purposes.  And rode us around in the minivan of death.

	Arik Devens <arik@mate.org> - Wrote the preferences code
	for EOG and provided many interesting conversations.  And lent
	me his comic books, which are insanely cool.

	Damien Diederen <dash@linuxbe.org> - Wrote the original fast
	scaling code that was the inspiration for EOG.

	Tuomas Kuosmanen <tigert@gimp.org> - Created the cute icon for

	GdkRGB, and some awesome code for doing imaging *fast*.
	Provided a botomless pit of knowledge.
