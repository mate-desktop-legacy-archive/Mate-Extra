================================================================

This is more or less an up-to-date (2005-05-29) list of things need to
be done on the code in the HEAD branch:


* Check for outdated thumbnails in .thumbnails directory (according to
freedesktop.org thumbnail specification).

* Remember the inner window layout in collection mode (window size and
position is already implemented)

* libeog/eog-job-manager.c: More tests required.
