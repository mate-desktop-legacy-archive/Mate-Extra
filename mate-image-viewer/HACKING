o In all other cases the following rules apply:

The code for Eye of Mate was written with several goals in mind:

	- maintainable,
        - extensible,
	- correct,
	- documented.

If you want to work on EOM as well, please read the MATE Programming
Guidelines first, understand their purpose, and keep them in mind when
writing code for EOM.

If you have a patch you would like to put into EOM, please file a bug
using http://bugzilla.gnome.org for the product EOM and attach the
patch to it.  This way your submisson won't get lost.
