 - Maybe change the keyboard and mouse navigation to do prelight stuff;
   only blue when you click or press enter or whatever?

 - Paste to jump to a character [done only in the case the chartable is focused
   and the pasted character is in the current script/block]

 - Write gtk docs for the charmap and mini_fontsel widgets.

 - Find out about strangenesses (like the list of DnD targets) and fix
   them if appropriate.

 - Think about the search; should it find computed hangul syllables,
   etc?

 - Edit menu. [UGLY. Not planning to do it.]

 - Maybe make the size of the zoom font configurable?

 - Tooltips on the scrollbar.

 - Daniel doesn't like the case (upper) of the character names.

 - Split Expand/Collapse All into two menu items? [this menu item is gone]

 - Save state???

 - Web browser-like forward/back for characters visited? Need to be
   smart about what to count as "visited".

 - gunihan, another program in the gucharmap package, with the same
   functionality as http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihansearch.html
   (suggested by Sebastien).

 - All features in unibook.

 - Include as much of the unidata as makes sense.

 - Hide gucharmap-chartable-*accessible.[ch] symbols.

- Fix zoom window positioning; sometimes it doesn't work.

- Fix expose slowness.

- GucharmapScriptCodepointList should use GUnicodeScript instead of strings
