General Information
===================

This is version 2.30.4 of gedit. gedit is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text
editor for the MATE environment.

gedit is part of MATE and uses the latest GTK+ and MATE libraries.
Complete MATE integration is featured, with support for Drag and Drop (DnD) 
from Caja (the MATE file manager), the use of the MATE help system,
the MATE Virtual File System and the MATE print framework.

gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets you edit more than 
one document at the same time.

gedit supports most standard editing features, plus several not found in your 
average text editor (plugins being the most notable of these).

gedit plugins may also be written in the python scripting language: to enable
python support you need the pygtk and mate-python-desktop bindings.

Although new features are always under development, currently gedit has:

    * Complete support for UTF-8 text
    * Syntax highlighting
    * Support for editing remote files
    * Search and Replace
    * Printing and Print Previewing Support
    * File Revert
    * A complete preferences interface
    * Configurable Plugin system, with optional python support


Some of the plugins, packaged and installed with gedit include, among others:

    * Word count
    * Spell checker
    * Change case of selected text
    * File Browser
    * Automatic snippet expansion
    * Sort
    * Insert Date/Time
    * External Tools
    * Tag list

Other external plugins are also available.

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the MATE bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.mate.org, product gedit). You will need to create an
account for yourself.

You can also report bugs using the MATE program bug-buddy.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and mate libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stack trace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

See the file 'BUGS' for the list of known bugs.


Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.mate.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
