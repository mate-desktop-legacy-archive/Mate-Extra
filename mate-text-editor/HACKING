guidelines for gedit
====================

gedit source code is maintained using the git version control system
and is available at the following location:

    git://git.mate.org/gedit

Or if you have an account on MATE servers:

    ssh://USERNAME@git.mate.org/git/gedit

A Web Interface is available at:

    http://git.mate.org/cgit/gedit

Please don't commit directly to the git repository unless
you have been given the green light to commit freely to gedit. 
When in doubt assume you haven't ;-).

Please attach patches in bugzilla (http://bugzilla.mate.org).
If the patch fixes a bug that is not reported yet in bugzilla or is
an enhancement, create a new bugreport.

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation,
fix typos in the code, etc.

Please send patches for build & configure fixes too.  I really appreciate
your help, I just want to review these fixes before applying.

If you are a "build sheriff", feel free to commit fixes for build and 
configure (please, send me an e-mail with the patch you have applied).

When committing to the gedit git repository make sure to include a
meaningful commit message. Changes without a sufficient commit message
will be reverted. Commit messages should have the following format:

=== begin example commit ===
Short explanation of the commit

Longer explanation explaining exactly what's changed, whether any
external or private interfaces changed, what bugs were fixed (with bug
tracker reference if applicable) and so forth. Be concise but not too brief.
=== end example commit ===

  - Always add a brief description of the commit to the _first_ line of
    the commit and terminate by two newlines (it will work without the
    second newline, but that is not nice for the interfaces).

  - First line (the brief description) must only be one sentence and
    should start with a capital letter unless it starts with a lowercase
    symbol or identifier. Don't use a trailing period either. Don't exceed
    72 characters.

  - The main description (the body) is normal prose and should use normal
    punctuation and capital letters where appropriate. Normally, for patches
    sent to a mailing list it's copied from there.

  - When committing code on behalf of others use the --author option, e.g.
    git commit -a --author "Joe Coder <joe@coder.org>" and --signoff.


Thanks,

  The gedit team.
