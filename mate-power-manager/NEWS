Version 2.31.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2010-08-06

* Important note:
 - This is 2.31.6, which is forked from the mate-2-30 branch.
 - If you have been using 2.31.5 or any earlier 2.31 version, then you will
   notice the UI and functionality going back in time. This is unfortunate.
 - MATE 3 has been pushed back 6 months, and the GSettings and GtkApplication
   code is not ready for prime-time just yet. I'm not willing to add multiple
   levels of ifdef'd code for the n-permutations of distros on different GTK
   and GLib versions, so people are just going to make do with 3.30.x with
   a few backported bugs and translation fixes. I do apologise to the
   translators, who have wasted some time on translating git master.
 - This release does not use the new control center panel, GDBus or GSettings.
 - I don't intend on wasting time backporting features from git master into
   MATE 2.32.x. Bugfixes will be, where they make sense.
 - In my personal opinion, MATE 2.32.0 is going to blow goats.

Version 2.25.1
==============

- Rewrite engine to support DeviceKit-power
- Rewrite statistics graphing application to support DeviceKit-power
- NOTE: you can still build g-p-m without DeviceKit-power, but functionality
  is very limited, and there are no statistics or battery profiling available.
  It's also not tested by me. The next release will probably have the HAL
  compatability code removed completely.
- Distros that do not yet ship DeviceKit-power can ship packages from
  MATE_POWER_MANAGER_2_24_X which is still maintained.

================
Version 2.17.90
================

Released January 22, 2007

General

 - Add the start of a self-test framework.
 - Fix a metric ton of spelling errors in the yelp file.
 - Add a BrightnessChanged signal for the brightness applet.

Power Manager

 - Change default to be ondemand at 85 performance on AC and ondemand at 25
   performance on battery.
 - Add this new dbus interface so we can provide an alternate UI environment,
   for instance for XFCE or OLPC.
 - Use correct mate-keyring-1 include directory. #388815
 - Point the applets help to the applets section in the main help file. #388904.
 - Don't localise battery description string as this is used internally for
   icon name. (Pascal Terjan)
 - Emit the correct signals when HAL disconnects or connects. This fixes the
   problem where the icon does not change when HAL is restarted.
 - Make sure we always use an SetBrightness int for brightness. This fixes a
   crash for people using the new libsmbios dell addon in HAL. #395174.
 - Merge BrightnessLcd and Dpms into Backlight so we can use this interface
   in a more generic way.

Power Preferences

 - Fix popup_menu callback signature. (Christian Persch) #390172.
 - Add /apps/mate-power-manager/show_cpufreq_ui MateConf key. It's not something
   I wanted to do, as 99% of people don't need to ever change this, but the
   1% will need to for specific systems. Default to hiding the control.
   Distros can patch this if required.
 - Categorize mate-power-preferences for the control center shell.
   (Denis Washington) #394701.

==============
Version 2.17.4
==============

Released December 18, 2006

General

 - Fix lots of typos in the yelp file. #380920, #381928, #381930.
   (Jorge Gonzalez)
 - Add mate-power-bugreport.sh so we can automatically get the
   distro version and stuff from HAL using the fantastic new
   X-MATE-Bugzilla-ExtraInfoScript.

Power Preferences

 - Remove the auto-sleep type from the UI.
 - Revert the glade file design to be similar to the 2.16 layout.
   This means we have On Ac Power and On Battery Power rather than
   the actions tabs. The change wasn't popular.
 - Various grammar changes as suggested by Tino Meinen.

==============
Version 2.17.3
==============

Released December 04, 2006

General

 - Add the initial versions of the inhibit and brightness applets.
 - Update the window title to be Power History rather than Power Graphs to
   match the drop down menu. #364200
 - Only allocate a buffer once, globally. #363991 (Stu Hood)
 - Fix several build errors on Solaris. #364621 (Harry Lu)
 - Lots of code structure changes, so now task-gobjects are now responsible
   for applying policy. Actions are now mostly asyncronous and modular.
   Code is now easier to understand IMO, and has a better structure.
 - Add really basic support for sounds when critical events happen, for
   instance if suspend fails and the lid is shut. Prevents melting.
   This uses gst-launch to use gstreamer. Add some sample sounds done by me.
 - Convert multi-instance code from libguniqueapp to GtkUnique.
 - Add mate-keyring functionality to lock keyrings when sleeping. #375681
 - Use GtkUnique rather than libguniqueapp. Optional but recommended dep.

Power Manager

 - Add proper support for detecting broken batteries with UI to ignore
   and visit the vendor page. Requires a new hal-info to work.
 - Add code to detect when we didn't quite make it back from resume.
   This functionality requires a patch to HAL to work. (David Zeuthen)
 - Add charging flash to match the other charging icons. #364574
 - Don't do *any* action until the battery data is marked as valid. (Stu Hood)
 - Fix an infrequent odd crash when we are suspending. (Pascal Terjan)
 - Sanity check the rate and time values in case the hardware really goes
   screwy for a few seconds, and gets the values wrong.
 - Set the libmatenotify window to NULL after we unref it, which will probably fix
   the crash in #365279
 - Only add and remove batteries if sane. This uses a hashtable to keep
   track of what batteries we are watching and should fix #369488.
 - When we add a DPMS state throttle, remove the last one if set.
   This fixes the bug where the screensaver would not show if
   DPMS had been allowed to activate. Fixes #355279.
 - Fix the bug that was causing the battery items to show on some desktops.
 - Fix a race where percentage_charge can be momentarily zero at startup.
   This fixes an incorrect 'fully charged' notification on startup.
 - Instead of showing "missing" as the catchall, show "discharging".
   #364450. (Stu Hood)
 - Calculate the smoothed rate from device caches, instead of devices.
   #361583. (Stu Hood)

Power Preferences

 - Change the checkbox to "Dim the display when the computer is idle" #363765

==============
Version 2.17.2
==============

Released October 18, 2006

General

 - Fix up the recent configure change to allow g-p-m to build without libnotity
   (Frederic Peters) #359824
 - Add in preliminary support for detecting batteries that might explode.
   See http://hughsient.livejournal.com/ for more details.

Power Manager

 - Fix the hal interface so we automatically connect up the device
   DeviceCondition and PropertyChanged on HAL restart. #349842
 - Remove a potential null-dereference, spotted by Joseph Sacco. #356667
 - Replace the hardware info pane with a drop-down of devices. #356804
   This saves another 200kb from the daemon process.
 - Add initial support for keyboard backlight device - this works with
   the Apple Macbook Pro. (David Zeuthen) #357994
 - Only load the GpmHal* interface gobjects if we have the hardware.
   This saves another 100k of writable memory on my desktop PC.
 - Use the localised general string to describe the battery device in the
   dropdown. #362690.
 - Add XEVENTS functionality. This allows g-p-m to respond to events sent
   by X, as soon the kernel is going to be outputting INPUT events.
 - Fix up a couple of small memory leaks detected by valgrind.

Power Preferences

 - Fix guniqueapp support for the preferences program (Elijah Newren)
   and add support in the statistics program.
 - Make the auto-sleep functionality disable feature easier to understand.

Power Statistics

 - mate-power-statistics now works instead of the "Information" screen
   that we used before. As it this is out of process we save 300kb for each
   instance of mate-power-manager daemon running.
 - We can now trivially add new graph types and export them over DBUS.
 - The statistics application now includes light/dark coloured symbols with
   different shapes for colour-blind or partially sighted people.
 - mate-power-statistics now remembers settings between invocations.
 - Add a proper tango gpm-statistics tango icon. (Jakub Steiner)
 - Add an icon the the statistics program to the "System Tools" menu.

==============
Version 2.17.1
==============

Released September 18, 2006

General

 - Add processor frequency scaling support. Requires HAL 0.5.8.
 - Create a new class to handle a managed proxy, i.e. a DBusGProxy that
   automatically does sane things with bus disconnects, or service restarts.
 - Add libguniqueapp shared library support. This is optional.
 - Update yelp images to reflect 2-16 and generally pretify the help xml.
 - Add in the debug option so we can easier debug g-p-m. Now adding the
   options --debug=power --debug=manager will only display the gpm-power
   and gpm-manager debug output.
 - Move to power measurement in percentages in the spec to better suit low
   power laptops and OLPC.
 - Allow power users to turn off the disconnect and reconnection feature of
   NetworkManager on sleep and resume using mateconf.
   (Khashayar Naderehvandi) #353431
 - Add /apps/mate-power-manager/session_request_save so distros like
   Ubuntu can just switch a mateconf key rather than patch the source.
 - Start to implement org.mate.PowerManager.Statistics for the
   out-of-process graphing interface. It actually doesn't do much yet.
 - Use DPMS_METHOD_OFF when we specify "default" for the DPMS action when on
   laptop hardware. Suspending the screen keeps the backlight on. #354726

Power Manager

 - Fix a couple of small memory leaks where we don't free the icon name.
 - Don't rescan buttons every minute. This task belongs in HAL. #356170
 - Remove eggtrayicon support. This means we depend on GTK+ 2.10. #356150
 - Fix hotplug add and remove of wireless mice.
 - Don't express the decimal point for the / 7 csr scale
 - Remove the broken battery FIXME. It's breaking more laptops that it was
   intended to fix and also breaks my old iBook. #334212
 - Fix some small memory leaks. (Paolo Borelli). #352858.

Power Preferences

 - Update the UI to be task-centric, rather than state centric. This is
   required now the preferences tool is starting to become a bit cleverer.
 - Add elements in the UI to prevent g-p-m from modifying the brightness
   on AC state change. Also add in the UI for the keyboard light sensor
   but disable it for now. #356085
 - Make sure that session connection is not NULL at startup. #353769.

===============
Version 2.15.91
===============

Released August 07, 2006

General

 - Turn on the monitor unconditionally, as we may be using a smart-card to
   authenticate and DPMS might still be on. #350291.
 - Hide the 'Device Information' window if we have no devices.
 - Add in an extra battery charged check to avoid repetition in the battery
   charged notification under some circumstances. #348938
 - Fix all cases reported by sparse/gcc (Kjartan Maraas). #350058
 - Move the roadmap into the TODO so it's easier to update.
 - Make mate-screensaver connection more resilient to bus failures. #349794
 - Poll all the buttons every minute to detect a silent lid close event. #346082
 - Reset the action timer after an ac_adapter event has been received. #348201
 - Add support for different DPMS sleep modes to support broken monitors.
   Patch from William Waghorn, many thanks.
 - Make the precision of the power supply and power rate more reasonable.
 - Install the 24x24 icons to get rid of the fuzzyness of the tray icon in some
   circumstances. This optionally requires ImageMagick. #348994
 - Fix a typo where we were trying to assign the wrong icon names so the
   battery missing icon didn't show up (instead showed a gtk-broken-image) #348710
 - Fix a crasher where the g-s timeout was larger than the max range for
   mate-power-preferences. #347932

==============
Version 2.15.4
==============

Released July 09, 2006

General

 - Change dbus Inhibit and UnInhibit methods to use a UINT32 rather than INT32,
   as this is specified in the spec.
 - Fix a compile error when we are compiling the non-libmatenotify sections of
   the code, which probably don't happen that often. #344674 (Elijah Newren)
 - Make a few more shared classes into singletons to save memory and CPU.
 - Allow use of --disable-schemas-install on autoconf level for disabling
   registering MateConf schemas. (Tomasz Kłoczko)
 - Change /apps/mate-power-manager/check_type_cpu default to false after
   discussion in #326742.
 - Add a test program that allows us to test the multiple inhibit stuff,
   and also to show people how easy it is adding Inhibit and UnInhibit calls
   into an existing program.

Power Manager

 - Support MacBook Pro with it's crazy number of brightness states. #346080
 - Add in initial support to check with PolicyKit over dbus. #344171
 - Logically seporate the help file, and add loads of new content.
 - Allow the user to ignore the inhibit requests from stopping a policy action.
   The key /apps/mate-power-manager/ignore_inhibit_requests can be set to true,
   and the action will still go ahead.
 - Use the same logic as the tooltip for the notification. #345698
 - Only refresh the caches on the last PropertyModified split event to save CPU.
 - Beep if we stopped the action due to an inhibit to warn the user. #345595
 - Make sure machines that do their own dimming get special cased and just set
   the brightness once.	This really *ought* to be a HAL propery. #345258.
 - Fix missing _() macros on some strings (Paweł Marciniak)

Power Preferences

 - Replace the word 'Interactive' in the UI with 'Ask me'. #345960

Power Info

 - Fix the horizontal time scaling so the graph scales correctly.
 - For non-laptops, hide the new power graphs and do not keep polling the values.
 - Read the correct key to get the max time. #345256 (Crispin Flowerday)
 - Big statistics module re-write, which should squash a couple of crasher bugs.

 - Add in new docbook documentation about the dbus interface.
 - Rename and add a few DBUS methods from feedback on XDG list.

Power Manager

 - Actually show the correct levels in the pixmaps for the mouse and keyboard.
 - Add a mateconf key so we can disable the action for when the lid is previously
   shut and the AC power removed at a later time as this was causing confusion.
 - Limit the capacity to 100%
 - Undim the screen when we have to unlock returning from resume. #333290

General

 - Remove all suspend-to-{x} terminology in the code and documentation in favour
   of hibernate and suspend (http://live.mate.org/MatePowerManager/SleepNames).
 - Update the FAQ URL. #330889

Power Manager

 - Allow the use of GtkStatusIcon as eggtrayicon is depreciated.
 - Ensure we set the icon to visible for battery-less desktops, as before we
   had to sometimes toggle the state in g-p-p to get it to show.
 - Make sure we only set the icon if it is different to the one already
   displayed to fix the case where the icons get renamed on package upgrade. #340557.
 - Add support for the new HAL key laptop_panel.brightness_in_hardware to
   properly support key brightness changing on IBM X31 laptops. #340231.
 - Do not warn multiple times about the critical action. #333622.
 - Add the ability to handle a transparent background in the tray icon.
   #341227 (Peter Grundström)

   what were shipped in the HAL 0.5.7 tarball.
 - Slightly re-work a patch from Paul Betts to handle broken batteries that
   report they are neither charging or discharging by using ac_adaptor
   value instead.
 - Remove the --sm-disable from the .desktop file in autostart since it breaks
   the logout dialog (e.g. on power button) if it is not run with session
   access. lp:31103 and #339168
 - Rework the way throttling is done so that it properly ref-counted and remove
   the compatibility with the old g-s API. #340024 (William Jon McCann)

Power Preferences

 - Add the new checkboxes to set the low power mode policy. #340355

Power Info

 - Make sure the time scale cannot be less than 10 minutes as smaller values
   show the approximation errors in the event-logging code. #340217.
 - Compute the legend width using Cairo instead of hard-coding it. #340218.
 - Correct a format string so we don't sometimes crash on ppc platform. #339974
 - Add more description in the event log, for why we do particular actions.

   to 95% as some batteries charge to 100% and then fluctuate from ~98% to
   100%. #338281
 - Error alerts should use an OK button. #336997
 - Monitor some more mateconf keys so we don't have to restart to get the new
   settings. #338628
 - Fix where the primary batteries are listed in the reverse order. #338634
 - Check that we do not set a higher brightness when we try to lower the
   brightness on idle. #338630.
 - Set libmatenotify point to the center of the icon. #338638
 - Set the default for the icon policy to only display if batteries are
   present so we don't display by default on desktops. rh:187140.
 - Make sure the inhibit cookie we generate is really unique. #339307.

Power Preferences

 - Add the action "Do nothing" so we don't have to do the DPMS action off for
   the external monitor. #338689
 - Fix the notebook tabs on desktop system, so we don't hide "General".

Power Info

 - Added an event log tab, and make the event code more robust.
 - Adding code so that the graphs can start at non-zero.

Version 2.15.0
==============

Released April 06, 2006

General

 - Drop support for obsolete versions of libmatenotify, DBUS and HAL.
 - Code quality improvements (Paolo Borelli)
 - More gtk-doc comments added to all the files.
 - Remove the scons-based build system for now.
 - Use g_option instead of popt (Jaap Haitsma)
 - Install new icons to /usr/share/icons/hicolor and do gtk-update-icon-cache
   when we install. #336067
 - Add X-MATE-Bugzilla keys for use with bug buddy (Vincent Fretin).
 - Add the missing --daemon option to the man page (Ow Mun Heng).
 - Updated Yelp help file with more useful information.

Power Manager

 - Don't do the critical action when the battery value is 0% as this happens
   for a split second with some ACPI laptops on resume.
 - Deal sanely with HAL and DBUS restarting.
 - Enable all the experimental code, such as the info window and the graphs.
   The graphs have had some serious Cairo lovin' and look pretty slick now,
   and should display more accurate data that we were displaying before.
   We also include a legend so that power events can be seen graphically.
 - Use the button "battery" rather than "www" to show battery status. lp:35633
 - Don't inhibit, but throttle when the lid is shut. #332576.
 - Update caches when we resume. For the matching HAL patch see:
   http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=187396#c10
 - Add a brightness widget that matches the volume popup when we change the
   brightness using the keyboard shortcuts.
 - Rewrite the screensaver integration so that g-s and g-p-m can be restarted
   independently and started in any order. #332366
 - Fix the expose event handling (Crispin Flowerday)
 - Use g_slice rather than g_new for the small data-points.
 - Use /apps/mate-power-manager/show_actions_in_menu rather than the compile
   setting ACTIONS_MENU_ENABLED to disable the actions menu. #335415
 - Add urgency states and the correct icons to libmatenotify windows.
 - Synchronize DPMS policy after a suspend or hibernate. #336081
 - Work around a HAL bug with CSR mice and keyboards so they display the
   correct charge after a short delay.
 - Set resume time at startup to let actions settle. (Daniel Silverstone)

Power Preferences

 - Layout improvements (Jaap Haitsma, William Jon McCann) #335991, #336207

==============
Version 2.14.0
==============

Released March 14, 2006

General

 - Add the --enable-experimental-features flag so that cool new stuff that is
   not really polished can be added. #326741, #333146
   - Add simple charge, rate and time graph widgets drawn using Cairo.
     This is for #333146 so we can draw cool graphs of power stuff.
   - Create a treeview for each device type so we can display detailed
     information for each device instance.

Power Manager

 - Ignore DBUS timeouts so long suspends do not "fail". (Ray Strode)
 - Add functionality so we can ignore events just after from resume.
   This is adapted from the Ubuntu patch by Daniel Silverstone. rh:185273
 - Make UI logic more sane by using the new "present" key value. lp:33388
 - Poke the screensaver to simulate user input. This is what Windows does, and
   should solve the problems with the timer event happening shortly after the
   ac_adapter is removed. #333525
 - Unrealize the icon when we hide it, else it leaves a 1px line on the
   notification tray. Fixes a transparent panel. #333515
 - Don't try to lock if mate-screensaver is not running.

Power Preferences

 - Only match primary batteries when showing the battery tab.
 - HIG fixes: spacing and capitalization (Dennis Cranston)

Released March 03, 2006

General

 - Install autostart files to new (definitive) place (Rodrigo Moya)
 - Add a logging interface so that we can log *why* a specific action was
   taken, logged in /var/log/messages. #332760.
 - We have to handle the PropertyModified events differently depending on
   whether we are using dbus 0.60 or dbus 0.61.	(Sjoerd Simons)
   NOTE: You should use 2.13.93 if you are using dbus 0.61.

Power Manager

 - Fix a crash when a very low power mouse is inserted. rh:183127.
 - Fix the UPS "charged" icon. #332761
 - Add a configurable action for the hibernate button and the power button.
 - Wait for mate-screensaver to lock before we suspend (Daniel Silverstone)
 - Display a BIG FAT warning in the event of DBUS not being present instead of
   just aborting like we do now.
 - Update with new bluecurve suspend and hibernate icons. (Diana Fong)
 - Ignore timeout events when the lid is closed, as we don't want to re-enable
   the screen when the user moves the mouse (on systems that do not support
   hardware blanking). lp:22522
 - Inhibit activation of the screensaver when the lid is closed.
 - Use a better way to work out if the battery is not charging. #333169
 - Standardise on longer timeouts for the libmatenotify boxes. lp:33411
 - Fix the repeated "battery is fully charged" messages if hardware is
   a little wonky. lp:32650, rh:183612

 - Describe what we are going to do better, so we don't say we are going to
   shutdown when we just are going to hibernate.
 - Add the new key notify_hal_error to set the policy for HAL failure
   notifications. Default true to display. Fixes #332440

===============

Released February 15, 2006

General

 - Add a scons build framework. #328708
 - Add debugging framework so traces are more manageable.
 - Vastly updated yelp file with lots more information. #324977

Power Manager

 - Fix the icon and tooltip for UPS's. #329027
 - Do an exponentially weighted average for the rate so that high frequency
   changes are smoothed. This should mean the time_remaining does not
   change drastically between updates. #328927.
 - Inform the user if the HAL command failed, and point them in the direction
   of the on-line FAQ page. #330889
 - We can restart hald without killing g-p-m. #327234

=============
Version 0.3.4
=============

Released January 17, 2006

- We now depend on HAL 0.5.6 for the new suspend, hibernate and shutdown
  functionality. HAL 0.5.6 is available in my repo for FC4.
- Source releases are now done on the MATE ftp servers:
  ftp://ftp.mate.org/pub/MATE/sources/mate-power-manager/
- We now only show Suspend and Hibernate options when HAL says we should.
  NOTE: just because HAL (i.e. the kernel) says it has hibernation or suspend
  support is compiled in, doesn't automatically mean that it will *work*.
- DPMS has moved into mate-power-manager from mate-screensaver, thanks
  to the work from William Jon McCann. There now is a DBUS interface to
  control this new functionality (#326276)
- org.mate.MatePowerManager -> org.mate.PowerManager (#326492)
- MATE Power Manager now listens for the new idle signals from g-s.
- There now is a yelp help file (#324977), thanks to Jaap Haitsma.
- Lots of new translations: Greek (Nikos Charonitakis), Gujarati (Ankit Patel),
  Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall), Catalan (Josep Puigdemont i Casamajó),
  Thai (Theppitak Karoonboonyanan), Serbian (Slobodan D. Sredojevic).
- Lots of updated translations: Galician (Ignacio Casal Quinteiro), 
  Hungarian (Gabor Kelemen), Bulgarian (Alexander Shopov), 
  Norwegian (Kjartan Maraas), Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador), 
  Simplified Chinese (Funda Wang), Lithuanian (Žygimantas Beručka), 
  Italian (Daniele Medri), French (Guillaume Savary), Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela).
- We now try to save the MATE application state before the critically-low
  action is taken (default shutdown).
- The power button is now an interactive shutdown, saving MATE session state.
- Fix a bug where the preferences program was crashing on missing mateconf schema.
- Fixed lots of other smaller bugs such as (#322773), (#323135), (RH#174196),
  (#322547), (RH#172963), (RH#176656).
- Lots of source file re-organisation, also a large refactoring. Thanks to 
  William Jon McCann for the large amount of code cleanup done.
- Fix problem where preferences window is redrawn and then resized (#323562)
- Don't crash if mate-panel is restarted, but display the icon again (#324446)
- Fix problem where battery is removed, and icon does not change (#323563)
- Made the warning about the AC adapter and the battery full mateconf
  configurable, fixing RH#176433 and (#325876).

=============
Version 0.3.1
=============

Released November 28, 2005

- Now we disconnect and reconnect NetworkManager when suspending and resuming.
- Default is now to suspend on lid close. At least we should assume it will
  succeed, rather than assume it will fail.
- Lots of HIG changes in g-p-p by Jaap Haitsma, thanks.
- If we are an IBM Thinkpad, don't dim the screen gently, as the BIOS does
  this automatically on it's own.
- Add the beginning of a console g-p-m for GDM (prototype).
- Add screensave 'Poke' so we can interrupt the screensaver instead of waiting
  for a keypress after a suspend or hibernate resume.
- Build fixes so we can build with DBUS head (and 0.60 when released).
- Fixed a bug where the correct brightness wasn't being set on battery boot.
- Added an option in g-p-p so that password protected resume is an option.
- If you are having problems with crashes or missing settings, please uninstall
  the mate-power-manager 0.2.8 rpm, and install 0.3.1, rather than upgrading.
  The old rpm post line in 0.2.8 causes the new mateconf schema to be uninstalled.
- Also fix a bug which makes the last bug doubly worse, by not crashing on
  missing mateconf schema, but handling it gracefully, and guessing some defaults.
- Lots of translation updates.

=============
Version 0.3.0
=============

Released November 15, 2005

- Schema is now properly applied in the RPM spec file.
- Fix the tooltip so that we don't display "Unknown Remaining"
- Wireless mice and keyboards now generate messages when battery low.
- Now align the menu to the bottom (or top) of the notification area like
  all the applets do.
- Website is now hosted on mate.org servers:
  http://www.mate.org/projects/mate-power-manager/
- New WIKI with all the things in progress and TODO:
  http://live.mate.org/MatePowerManager
- Update the website to be more MATEy, copied from the caja template.
- Lots of Makefile.am and configure tidy ups with thanks to JP Rosevear.
- Removed gpm-dbus-test and made the DBUS interface *much* simpler
- Multiple batteries and wireless device support massivly improved due
  to a new underlying calculation engine. Lots of cruft has been ripped out.
- Laptops that don't turn off the backlight when the lid is shut are now
  automatically turned off using DPMS.
- Notification icon now only appears when batteries low, or optionally
  when discharging and charging. The options have been turned to radio buttons
  to make options clearer. Also icons are now at 24x24 to conform to the
  MATE HIG.
- libmatenotify messages now replace one another, so the screen isn't littered
  with "battery is critically low" messages.
- Replace our own "dumb" icon management with the MATE stock icon functions,
  with thanks to Jaap Haitsma.
- Lots of translation updates.

===============
Version 0.2.8.1
===============

Released October 25, 2005

- Fix a NULL pointer dereference where the remaining_time isn't known, and
  the battery is low.
- Don't crash when we do not have mate-dev-memory in our theme.
- We now register the name of the application with the session-manager.
- Change HAL dep from 0.5.4 to 0.5.3 so we can build on Ubuntu Breezy.
  NOTE: There are *lots* of bugs in HAL 0.5.3 fixed in later releases.
- Now delete Makefile.in when doing maintainer-clean rather than distclean
  so we can build on Ubuntu Breezy.

=============
Version 0.2.8
=============

Released October 17, 2005

- All source files are now fully documented with Doxygen.
  http://mate-power.sourceforge.net/doxygen/
- Fixed problems with displaying the just the AC Adapter icon.
  Thanks to Dumitru Ciobarcianu for reporting the problem.
- Added desktop mode where icon is forced. Disabled by default.
  The icon handling logic is to be simplified in 0.2.10
- Fixed a fatal error where a NULL pointer was deferenced when removing
  AC Adaptor when icon was hidden.
- Lots of cosmetic fixes thanks to Wouter Bolsterlee.
- Add back the (now themed) icons to mate-power-preferences.
- Add a new tool, mate-power-info to display the p-m capabilities or your
  machine, and report details of your power hardware. More to come...
- Lots of cosmetic fixes from Wouter Bolsterlee.
- We now detect when HAL is restarted and warn the user accordingly.
- When setting the low battery and critical battery threholds, we now
  tell the user how much time they would have. This only works for ACPI
  when discharging, as HAL doesn't give us discharge data when charged.

=============
Version 0.2.6
=============

Released October 01, 2005

- MATE Screensaver support runtime detection has been improved
  (no timeouts now, and console messages supressed)
- Fixed lots of 64bit warnings thanks to Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>
- MATE Power Manager is now in Fedora Core Rawhide!
- The screen now dims gently (rather than a big brightness change) when
  changing brightness states.
- We now support ONLY the new SetBrightness HAL API in HAL CVS.
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.hal/3280
  You will have to be using HAL CVS for brightness changing to work.
- We now do not require libhal as all communication to hald is done through
  the DBUS glib bindings.
- All source files now have lots of asserts that should make any code logic
  errors easy to spot. Please report any regressions.
- Thanks to Robert Love, we now daemonize when being run. Use --no-daemonise
  to disable this.
- A new "About" box that follows the MATE HIG...
- A new "Information" tab that tells you a bit about your computers' power
  management capability. This is very young and will have much more
  information in the future about batteries, UPS's etc. Help welcome.
- Lots of fixes and improvements to the core code, with thanks to Theetjuh
  and Myk Melez for testing the code so well.
- MATE Power Manager now notifies you your battery is low *and* how much time
  you have remaining. This fixes a regression from 0.2.2.
- Working with MATE Screensaver, we now work out the idle time so we can
  suspend or hibernate in a period of keyboard and mouse in-activity. 
  The load value is also computed, so we can avoid sleeping when CPU 
  intensive programs are left running, e.g. kernel compiles or simulations.

=============
Version 0.2.4
=============

Released September 21, 2005

- We now have an experimental yum repo that contains all the needed updates
  for a standard FC4 system.
  You do not now have to update your fedora system to the unstable
  rawhide repo. All packages have been built by me for FC4.
- Comboboxes now only have "sane" values available.
- Lots more code cleanups, and more modularization.
- 100% GLIB DBUS support - this is faster than libhal, but has not been tested
  much, and is disabled for now. Use ./configure --enable-glibhal to test.
- DBUS services now works, so we init g-p-m with just a query to 
  org.mate.MatePowerManager. This makes it easy to make sure g-p-m has been
  started, or to start g-p-m when we start Power Preferences.
- Now we control MATE Screensaver so that we don't use screensavers on battery
  but just blank the screen.
- Lots of updates to the website.
- Fixed specfile to be in RedHat approved format.
- Now we only call SetLowPower if system.formfactor is laptop.
- We detect MATE Screensaver at runtime, rather than with a configure option.

=============
Version 0.2.2
=============

Released September 07, 2005

- Fixed the problem where the notification icon wasn't being shown by default.
- We now check for the presence on the session and system dbus connections,
  and tell the user what they have to do, to fix the problem.
- New Polish translation by Michał Kastelik
- Switch to using org.mate.MatePowerManager rather than net.sf.MatePower
- Add the new DBUS api calls isOnBattery(), isOnUps(), and isOnAC() and 
  remove isRunningOnMains().
- LCD slider brightness now adjusts the correct immediate state while on 
  battery power and AC.
- Fix from wrobell to fix compilation on PLD Linux.
- Made docbook2man optional. If this program is missing, the man files will 
  not be built.	Suggested by Eugenia Loli-Queru to fix Arch Linux compilation.
- Add lots more answered questions on the FAQ page.

=============
Version 0.2.1
=============

Released September 5, 2005

- The reboot and halt mateconf typos have been fixed.
- Lots more code compliant with C99.
- mate-power-manager now sports a --version argument.
- New Italian translation by Daniele Medri
- Fix a problem reported by Andrew Duggan where the incorrect ACPI reading was
  tripping up our over-zealous HAL checks.
- Rename LCDPanel to LaptopPanel to match HAL CVS. LCD brightness is
  officially supported now.
- Fix the combobox error for "Sleep Type"
- Website updated with a "bug reporting" section.

=============
Version 0.2.0
=============

Released August 31, 2005

- This new release brings lots of new features and updated translations.
- The preferences program now supports LCD brightness, and works with 
  mate-screensaver to set the DPMS timeout for monitors.
- The website has been updated with a new design with lots more content.
- *WARNING* this program depends on new DBUS and HAL libraries to install, 
  due to the recent changes in HAL. See the new FAQ page 
  (http://mate-power.sourceforge.net/faq.php) for more details.
- Working with HAL 0.5.4, lots of problems have been solved.
- This includes the need for a external DBUS daemon - now we use HAL to 
  launch scripts.
- Many more batteries are supported, as well as support for most of the 
  broken ACPI BIOSes.
- This release has had little testing (and a *lot* has changed internally 
  since 0.1.0), so expect a few bugs, and teething problems.
- The wait between 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 has been required for the newest HAL to be
  released. Expect more frequent releases in the future.

=============
Version 0.1.0
=============

Released July 12, 2005

- Massive changes!
- A new DBUS system daemon, pmscripts that you can edit for suspend2 or 
  swsup hibernation.
