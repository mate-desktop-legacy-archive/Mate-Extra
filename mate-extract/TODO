[ ] #547727 – file-roller crashed with SIGSEGV in strlen()

== ToDo ==

[ ] #525274 – File roller seems to be unable to create zipfiles without .zip extension

[ ] #512825 – Fails extraction of files within directories named '.'

[ ] #508737 – can't add file to the archive if archive name is without extension

[ ] #482560 – totem-like plugin installer for file-roller

[ ] Progress bar should not be file based, but content size based.
    Related to bug #153281

[ ] #543225 – File-Roller is unable to open gzip-compressed files like pci.ids if they are missing an .gz extension
   
[ ] It's not possible to load, modify, extract remote multi-volume archives.

[?] #501660 – File-roller caja extension creates tarbombs

[ ] #306403 – filenames in non-UTF-8 encodings are not handled correctly

[ ] #547982 – Failure dialog for file extraction should be more useful

[x] #350640 – sending an empty folder doesn't work

[x] LP#26662: file-roller fails to open .Z files

== DONE == 

[x] optimization of the add_folder operation: if the command supports all the
    requested options add the folder directly instead of reading the folder 
    and adding the content in chunks.
    
    Partially fixed for the commands that allow to specify the file list
    in a file, that is: tar, rar, 7zip.
    
[x] #153281 – Progress bar should be exact

    This is command dependent: fixed for tar, zip, 7zip, rar.

[x] #503940 – Various Archive Manager documentation mistakes
